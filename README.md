# Line Encoder And Scrambler
## Overview
> A static website build using **HTML5,Vanilla CSS3,jQuery,chart.js,Vanilla js,** and **wayPoint.js .**<br>
> For responsive design i have used **responsive grid layout** for sections and **float layout** for header and footer.<br>
> Both the layouts used are desgined to adjust at particular screen width using **css mediaQueries.**<br>

## Latest Deployment 
Deployment :- <a href="https://svsannidhay.github.io/Line_Encoder/" target = "_blank" >**Line Encoder and Scrambler**</a>

# Digital Data Generation
> Used vanilla javaScript for data generation.
> Used **Manacher's Algorithm** to find the longest palindromic substring in O(N) time.

# Encoding and scrambling part 
> Used **vanialla javaScript** for logic writting , encoding , scramling part.<br>
> For signal plotting i have used **Chart.js** library 
 
## NAVIGATION BAR
> There are in total three different nav bars each triggered under adequate conditions.<br>
> There is a **sticky Navigation bar** which is triggered when we pass our first section.<br>
> **Mobile Navigation** is triggered when screen width is below 1024 pixels.<br>
> Triggering for sticky nav bar is done by using **waypoints Js Library.**<br>
> Triggering for mobile nav bar is done by using **CSS MediaQueries.**<br>

## User interface 
> Every encoding or scrambling section have two interaction fields. <br>
> One on the left, here we have random Input generator in which we can input minimum no of consecutive zeros we must have in our randomly generated input.<br>
> One on the right, here we have a custom input section in which user can enter any valid boolean (Digital signal of form 1 or 0) and it will be treated as input.<br>
> Next we have generate buttons which onclick will enter the input accordingly and we have a encoded signal in form of the chart and the longest palindromic substring of the data elements. <br>
